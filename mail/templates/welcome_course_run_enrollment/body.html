            Once you have enrolled in a course or program with MIT xPRO, you can
            expect to gain access to the course materials and platform on the
            scheduled start date. You will not be able to access any of the
            course content before the start date and time. To log in and start

            Each course offers in-course discussion forums, allowing you to
            engage with fellow learners and receive support. Our dedicated

            <strong><u>Course Schedule and Deadlines:</u></strong
            ><br />
            Please be aware that each MIT xPRO course has its own schedule, with
            content becoming available after the course start date. Content
            releases typically adhere to a schedule determined by the course
            instructors, often on a weekly basis. Assignment deadlines are
            strictly enforced, and late submissions are not accepted. The course
            will conclude on a designated end date, at which point live aspects
            such as discussion forums will be closed.

            <strong><u>Where to Seek Support:</u></strong
            ><br />
            For inquiries related to in-course content, we recommend reaching
            out directly to the course team. They possess the expertise and have
            access to the course materials, making them best equipped to provide
            accurate and detailed responses. You can find the contact
            information for the course team within the courseware itself,
            typically in sections such as the Syllabus, Course Guide, or FAQ.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px">
            For non-sensitive course assignment questions, posting them in the
            in-course discussion forums is another valuable option. Our course
            assistants (CAs) actively monitor these forums, and fellow learners
            often contribute their insights and solutions.
