# user/cookie/header capture and max_request_body_size governs request bodies,
# and neither touches exception text.
#
# The newline is matched both raw and as a literal backslash-n: the SDK repr()s
# frame locals and non-string logging params during serialization, so there the
# DETAIL line arrives as "...constraint\\nDETAIL: ..." inside a repr string.

    puts it in logentry.params (EventHandler._emit), and captured stack-frame
    locals carry it in frame vars because include_local_variables defaults to
    True (serialize_frame).  Walking the whole event covers those without
    enumerating them, and does not go stale when the SDK adds another.

    Safe to walk naively because Client._prepare_event serializes the event
    before calling before_send, so every leaf here is already a JSON
    primitive -- no live exception objects to coerce.
